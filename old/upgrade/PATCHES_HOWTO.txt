Patches are a simple way to change the sql database of a production/test system without hurting the data in it.
To run it, simply run "./apply_patches.sh" in a terminal.

Every commit that changes the sql database needs to do three things:
1. Create a patch with a unique patch number and description
2. Update the createdb.sql database
3. Change the insert statement at the bottom of createdb.sql to match the one in the patch (Just change the number and description)

This way, any new users will be able to run the createdb.sql database like normal. Any users with existing databases can simply run apply_patches after pulling. (Note, this doesn't reverse anything and should only be used when moving forward)
