v0.5 - Timelapses + On-Deck Jobs - ETA: August 2013

BACKGROUND WORKER

* report OS / uname -a / memory size / cpu speed for each token - include in devices scan.
* extend botqueue to support generic jobs with json payload
* bot/worker should have configuration to specify what jobs it can process.
* job types: fabrication, toolpath generation, timelapse creation, 3d rendering, image processing, stl parsing
* main status: available / taken / qa / pass / fail / canceled
* sub-status (job specific)
  * downloading / working / uploading / etc.
* admin area to keep an eye on jobs status.
* admin area to view active workers.
* move job-specific execution to separate classes in jobs subfolder

CLOUD SLICING

* Create on-deck system to allow jobs to be pre-sliced by either the pi or by workers in the cloud
* Every time a certain action is triggered, the on-deck function will look at all bots, jobs, queues of a user and calculate all the on-deck jobs.
* The algorithm should set the on-deck job for each bot, generate a slice job if required, and invalidate any slice jobs that are no longer relevant.
* Modify bumblebee to download (and possibly slice) on-deck jobs for quick printing in the background.
  * this should probably be a single thread that loops through each bot and gets on-deck jobs and processes the download/slicing of them.
* Extend API to allow admin-authorized clients to grab and slice any available jobs.
* Add a config area on app token to specify what kind of token it is (bot, worker, slicer, etc)
* Setup a server with an instance of bumblebee that runs on ec2 and processes jobs.

TIMELAPSE GENERATION

* use the background worker system to generate timelapses of prints.
* automatically create a timelapse at the end of a successful print - watch your object grow
  * timelapse interval should be calculated to last an exact time... 10 seconds or so.
  * 30 frames/second * 10 seconds = 300 frames.
  * take list of bots and / 300, then loop through them and take every (total_count / 300)th frame.
  * aka index % (total_count / 30*10) == 0
  * keep all images from webcam on error jobs - forensic viewing of failed jobs.
    * automatically delete after 1 day.
* ffmpeg + x264 install: http://ffmpeg.org/trac/ffmpeg/wiki/UbuntuCompilationGuide
* ffmpeg timelapse from images: http://tatica.org/en/2013/02/15/timelapse/
* more timelapse commands: http://poohbot.com/2009/09/25/ffmpeg-for-time-lapse-sets-of-images-and-even-archiving/
* potential video player: http://videojs.com/
* delete all saved images after generating timelapse
* BONUS: synchronize temp readings + video - then synchronize images w/ temperatures on bot view page

BONUS FEATURES

* WEB - Single unified queue view w/ auto-update
  * combine queue page into single list of all open jobs w/ tabs to limit based on job status
* WEB - create page to show live shots from currently printing public bots or just shots from completed jobs
* API - Add callback url support for web-based apps
* WEB - add diff of slicer configs to slicejob page (current vs snapshot)
* BUMBLEBEE - Better / faster shutdown

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v0.6 - Websockets

* API - Websockets server
  * define events to pass to clients
  * subscribe to bots, jobs, or user?
  * use autobahn or tornado for python side.
  
* CLIENT - support for websockets for realtime comms w/ server

* WEB - websocket client w/ transparent high bandwidth connection to local machines.
* WEB - control panel for controlling various machine parameters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long term wants:

* WEB - filament spool info (it keeps track of how big each machine spool is/when a new one is installed and appoximates how much is left based on volume info in gcode)
  * PREREQUISITE: worker bots to parse STL files for stats like volume, bounds, etc.
  * add filament_volume field to slicejob or job
  
* WEB - print grouping using slic3r
  * modify jobs to add allow_grouping file
  * look at job grabbing to allow multiple jobs to be grabbed
  * look at bumblebee to allow multiple jobs to be grabbed
  * add option to allow job to be grouped into a single print
  * modify code to use slic3r --merge to create build plate.
  * create high-level job group to hold currently running jobs?

* WEB - Public queue support
* WEB - Team support to allow other users to control bots or queues.

* WEB - full page statistics for bot / queue with graphs

* BUMBLEBEE - s3g python library for MakerBot machines

* WEB - Reduce Amazon requirements for non-amazon / non-public installs.
* WEB - simple script for installing botqueue onto a standalone ubuntu machine
* WEB - 100% working Amazon bootup script.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Crazy ideas:

* BUMBLEBEE - GUI App?
	High-level views:
		Dashboard: all bots w/ current status and active jobs.
		Add Bot: configure local bot settings (drivers, name, etc)
		Bot Detail:
			* all info available on this bot
			* current print status
			* pause print
			* cancel print
			* toggle bot status: online/offline/fixed/broken
	* Use python+webkit for UI
